# **LimitCider**  
Once  upon a time, my pap went to a small farm auction, and saw an 1800's cider press.  
  
He had to have it - he brought it home and was berated by my grandma. "What are we gonna do with that giant hunk of junk!?", she said.  
  
Well, today, that hunk of junk presses ~250 gallons of apple cider every year, operated by the entire Wright family, in addition to droves of other friends, coworkers, and acquaintances.  

While I always had fun at the yearly cider "festival", there was one thing that bothered me - we never had a streamlined way to collect reservations/orders. It was always looking through the comments on 3 or 4 different Facebook accounts, trying to find who ordered what.  
  
A Google Form would work well, but I wanted to make it work **great**. This is where this repository comes in.  
  
## **Features**  
- **Form cutoff at specified limit**  
    - Automatically close the form once X gallons have been reserved  
- **Live Stats**
    - Show the customers how much cider is left, in real time  
- **Automatic Updates**  
    - The limit can be set on-the-fly by simply editing a spreadsheet. All associated values and form status is automatically re-computed.  
- **Email Notifications**  
    - Emails are sent at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% reservation status.  
  
This code effectively allows me to streamline collection of orders, while ensuring that not too many are placed. A spreadsheet can be printed out on the day of, and easily checked off as people get their apple cider.
